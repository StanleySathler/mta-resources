MTA Resources made by Stanley Sathler

If you do not know what is Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas, it is an amazing program that allow us to play GTA San Andreas on multiplayer mode. It has implemented a great Lua Virtual Machine, where we can implement our own scripts easily, building custom servers.

Here, I'll maintain all resources made by me. A lot of them even incompleted, since, sometimes, I stop my things before conclude them.
